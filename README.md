# Chess analysis

This is the code accompanying my blog post
[Engineering a chess match against my brother](https://blog.mbrt.dev/posts/chess-eng/).
It doesn't include the data I used, but you can easily download it for any
player on chess.com by using `download-games.py`.

**Note:** The code is pretty messed up and undocumented, as it was just a quick
experiment for myself.

## Contents:

* `download-games.py`: Download all games of a player from chess.com (Python).
* `analysis1.ipynb`: Initial experiments and positions evaluation with
  Stockfish (Jupyter notebook).
* `analysis2.ipynb`: Graph analysis of the positions given the precomputed
  evaluation (Jupyter notebook).
* `blog-post.ipynb`: Notebook I used to create images for the blog post.
